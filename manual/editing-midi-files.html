<h2>Editing Midi files</h2>

<h3 id="selecting">Selecting Events</h3>
<p>
   In order to edit Midi events, the events which will be edited have to be selected. There are many
   different ways how to select events. Events can be selected using the <a href="#std_tool">standard tool</a>
   or using one of the tools listed below.
 </p>
 <p>
   When pressing SHIFT while selecting events, the old selection will be extended with the newly selected events.
   In order to remove events from a selection, the events can be accessed as if you wanted to select them while pressing CTRL.
 </p>
 <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/select_single.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Select single Events</i><br>
      Click on an event in the view to select it.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/select_box.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Select Events (Box)</i><br>
			If you want to select more events at the same time you can use the &quot;Select Box&quot; Tool.
			Click at any point in the event view and drag the	appearing box. All events in the box will be selected.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/select_left.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Select all Events on the left side</i><br>
		  Select the tool and click at the wished	horizontal position. All events before the clicked position will be selected.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/select_right.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Select all Events on the left side</i><br>
			Select the tool and click at the wished	horizontal position. All events after the	clicked position will be selected.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
  When pressing CTRL+A, all visible events will be selected. Moreover, events from a specific track or from a specific channel
  can be selected using the according actions in the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=menu-edit">edit menu in the menubar</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="moving">Moving events</h3>
<p>
  Moving events will either change their start- and endtimes (horizontal movement) or the note height of note events (moving notes up and down).
  While the <a href="#std_tool">standard tool</a> can select and move events at the same time, selected events can either be moved with
  one of the tools listed below, or by accessing the according values of the events in the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=editor-and-components#event_editor">event editor.</a>
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/move_up_down_left_right.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Move Events (all directions)</i><br>
			Click inside the event view and drag the mouse in order to move
			all selected events.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/move_left_right.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Move Events (Left and Right)</i><br>
			Click inside the event view and drag the mouse in order to move
			all selected events horizontal.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/move_up_down.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Move Events (Up and Down)</i><br>
			Click inside the event view and drag the mouse in order to move
			all selected events vertical. This tool only works with note events.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
  Moreover, the timing of the events can be corrected by <a href=#quantization>quantifying</a> them.
</p>

<h3 id="duration">Changing the duration of events</h3>
<img src="pages/manual/tools/change_size.png" width="20px" height="20px" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>

<p>
  Resizing note events changes the start or the end time of the event - this means the duration of the note. All other events can not be resized.
  The duration of a note can either be directly set using the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=editor-and-components#event_editor">event editor</a> or by selecting the
  resizing tool (shown on the left). To use the tool, select the events to resize and move the mouse over the start or the end of a selected event.
  Drag the mouse in order to resize the event. The <a href="#std_tool">standard tool</a> can also resize events.
</p>

<h3 id="create_and_delete">Creating and deleting events</h3>

<img src="pages/manual/tools/newnote.png" width="20px" height="20px" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>
<p>
  Creating events can be done with the <a href="#std_tool">standard tool</a> or with the new events tool (shown on the left). Clicking inside the event view
  and dragging the mouse will create the events. New events will be assigned to the track and the channel which are defined in the lower right corner of the editor.
</p>
<img class="figure" src="pages/manual/screenshots/new-events.png" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>

<p>
  In order to remove events, you can press the DEL key which will delete all selected events. Moreover, events from a specific channel can be removed by clicking the according action in the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=menu-tools">tools menu</a>. The remove events tool can remove specific events.
</p>

<h3 id="std_tool">Standard Tool</h3>
<img src="pages/manual/tools/select.png" width="20px" height="20px" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>
<p>
	This tool is the most often used tool in MidiEditor. It provides a
	mixture of all selectable tools above. Events can be selected by
	clicking on them or by dragging a box around the events to select. In
	order to add an event to an already existing selection, hold the SHIFT key
	while selecting new events in the above explained manner. In order to
	remove individual events, hold CTRL and click on the events to deselect.
	Events can be moved up and down as well as left and right by clicking inside
	the event and dragging the mouse. Clicking at the left or right border
	of an event and dragging the mouse afterwards will change the duration
	and the starting time of the event. All actions will be applied to all selected events.
	Clicking the right mouse key will create new events.
</p>

<h3 id="magnet">Magnet and Raster</h3>
<img src="pages/manual/tools/magnet.png" width="20px" height="20px" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>
<p>
  When the magnet (shown on the left) is enabled, all dragging or shifting operations inside the event view will
  result in a timing which is aligned to the specified raster. That means that events will start at the correct time when the start time is close
  to the time which is represented by a vertical line in the event view. The raster size can be controlled from within the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=menu-view">view menu in the menubar</a>. It can be set to any known note length (eights, quarters etc.).
</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>
<img src="pages/manual/tools/quantize.png" width="20px" height="20px" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>
<p>
  While an event can start and end at any time, it is often required to make the timing &quot;correct&quot; which means,
  that the event starts at an exact position within the measure and have a duration which is equal to a known note duration (quarter, 8th, ...).
  This exact timing can be achieved by quantifying the events. Pressing the quantify button (shown on the left) will align all selected events to a grid.
  The size of this grid, the quantization fractions, can be controlled from within the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=menu-tools">tools menu in the menubar</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The following picture shows some notes before (left) and after (right) quantization. The quantization fractions were set to 8ths.
</p>
<img class="figure" src="pages/manual/screenshots/quantization.png" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>
<p>
  As tuplets are not aligned on the usual grid, you can select the events which belong to a tuplet und use the action quantify tuplet in order to
  correct a tuplet's timing.
</p>

<h3 id="copy_paste">Copying/Pasting Events</h3>

<p>
  In order to copy events, select the events to copy and press CTRL+C. This will copy the events to the clipboard. Set the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=playback#cursor">cursor</a>
  at the time where you want the copied events to start and press CRTL+V which will paste the events at the wished position.
</p>

<h3 id="timing">Editing Tempo and Meter</h3>
<p>
  Tempo and meter can be changed using the according tools.
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="pages/manual/tools/tempo.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></td>
		<td>
			<i>Edit Tempo</i><br>
			After selecting the tool, click inside the event view at the position were you want
                        to change the tempo. A dialog will pop up letting you enter the new tempo.
                        <br>
                        You can also select a time period by letting the mouse pressed after clicking and
                        moving the mouse to the end of the time period. This allows you to gradually increase
                        or decrease the tempo.

<h3 id="tracks-and-channels">Tracks and Channels</h3>

<p>
Each Midi file seperates its events in one or more tracks. Each track
can contain multiple channels.
</p>

<p>
Each track has a name. This name describes the tracks content. To change
it you can press the button <img src="pages/manual/tools/rename.png" width="12" height="12"/> in the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=editor-and-components#track_editor">track editor.</a>
A dialog will open up to enter the tracks new name.
</p>

<p>
To create a new track you can press the button <img src="pages/manual/tools/add.png" width="12" height="12"/> in the <a href="index.php?category=manual&subcategory=editor-and-components#track_editor">track editor.</a>
To remove a whole track you can press <img src="pages/manual/tools/remove.png"  width="12" height="12"/>. This will
delete all events of the selected track and the track itself.
If there is only one track left, this track can not be deleted.
</p>

<p>
Channel 0 - 15 are the instrument channels. They contain information
about the notes to play and the instruments sound. The sound of
the instrument can be chosen from a list of instruments. Press
<img src="pages/manual/tools/instrument.png"  width="12" height="12"/> in the channel list to change the instrument. This will open up the following dialog:
</p>

<img class="figure" src="pages/manual/screenshots/instrument.png" />

<p>
You can specify the instrument from the given list. Accepting the dialog
will set the channel's instrument in the beginning of the file to the
instrument from the list. Later in the file there may be Program Change
Events changing the channel's instrument. To prevent this, you can select
&quot;Remove other Program Change Events&quot; before accepting the
dialog. All other Program Change Events of the channel will be removed.
</p>
