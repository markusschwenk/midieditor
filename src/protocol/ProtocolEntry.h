 * into the Programs Protocol.
 * To protocol the state of a ProtocolEntry, the object is copied
 * (ProtocolEntry *copy())). When the Protocols Method undo() or redo() is
 * called, the ProtocolEntry has to reload his old state from the copy in the
 * Protocol (void reloadState(ProtocolEntry *entry)). Both Methods have to be
 * implemented in the Subclass.
 * Before a ProtocolEntry is changed it has to copy its old state to oldObj.
 * After changing itself, the Method protocol(ProtocolEntry *oldObj,
 * ProtocolEntry *newObj) has to be called, with "this" as newObj.
