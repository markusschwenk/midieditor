 *
 * \brief Protocol uses two stacks to store the history of the program.
 *
 * Protocol stores the history of the program, using two Stacks (the Stacks
 * are implemented as Lists): the redo stack and the undo stack. Both save
 * ProtocolSteps, in the order they have to be released to reload the old
 * state of the program.
 *
 * To add a ProtocolItem, there has to be opened a ProtocolStep calling
 * startNewAction(). To use the Protocol, open a ProtocolStep,
 * add some ProtocolItems calling enterUndoStep() and call endAction() to put
 * the ProtocolStep onto the undoStack.
 *
 * Starting a new Action will clear the redo stack.
