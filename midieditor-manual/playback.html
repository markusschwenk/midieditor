	<h1><b>Playback</b></h1>

	<p>
	  MidiEditor allows you to play the song when you have selected an
	<a href="setup.html#io">output device</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can find buttons for the playback in the <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a> or in the toolbar. There are buttons
	  which allow you to start a playback (or a recording, please read <a href="record.html">Recording Midi data</a> for more details), to
	  stop and pause the playback, and to control the	<a href="#cursor">cursor</a>. Moreover, individual tracks and channels can be
	  muted and the <a href="#metronome">metronome</a> can be controlled from within the <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="muting-tracks-channels"><b>Muting Tracks and Channels</b></h2>
	<p>
	  Sometimes it makes sense to play only specific channels or tracks in order to listen to one or more instruments at a time.
	  Hence, specific tracks and channels can be muted. If either the track or the channels assigned to a Midi event is muted, the event
	  will be ignored during the playback. Hence, notes of muted tracks and channels will not be audible during the playback.
	</p>
	<p>
	   In order to mute a specific track or a channel, please press <img src="tools/loud.png" width="12px" height="12px"/> in the according list in the
	   <a href="editor-and-components.html#track_editor">track editor</a> or the <a href="editor-and-components.html#channel_editor">channel editor</a>.
	   Click again in order to make the channel or track audible again.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Moreover, there are actions which allow you to mute or make audible all tracks or channels at once. These buttons can be found in the
	  <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a> as well as in the
	  <a href="editor-and-components.html#track_editor">track editor</a> or the <a href="editor-and-components.html#channel_editor">channel editor</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you want to play one channel alone, the channel can be marked to be the &quot;solo channel&quot;. This will automatically mute all other channels
	  without having to mute them manually. The solo mode can be entered by clicking <img src="tools/solo.png" width="12px" height="12px"/> for the according
	  channel in the <a href="editor-and-components.html#channel_editor">channel editor</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="cursor"><b>Setting the Cursor</b></h2>
	
	<img src="screenshots/setting-cursor.png"  align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />
	
	<p>
  	You can specify the position in the song where the playback starts when pressing the play button. This can be done by double clicking
  	into the time line above the <a href="editor-and-components.html#event-view">event view</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a> there
  	are additional actions which can move the cursor to the next or previous measure (<img src="tools/back.png" width="12px" height="12px"/> and
  	<img src="tools/forward.png" width="12px" height="12px"/>) or reset the cursor to start the playback at the beginning of the file (<img src="tools/back_to_begin.png" width="12px" height="12px"/>).
	</p>

  <h2 id="speed"><b>Speed</b></h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes it will be useful to slow done the playback speed (or to speed it up). This can be done by setting the playback speed in the
    <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a>. Setting the playback speed to 1 (default) will play at normal speed, while setting it to 2 will result in
    a two times faster playback speed. Playback speeds lower than 1 will slow down the playback.
  </p>
  
  
  <h2 id="metronome"><b>Metronome</b></h2>
  <img src="tools/metronome.png" align="right" width="40" height="40" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>
  <p>
    The metronome can be enabled or disabled in the <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a> or in the toolbar. Enabling the metronome will result in a
    metronome sound at each beat during the playback.
  </p>
   
  
	<h2 id="lock"><b>Locking the Screen</b></h2>
	<p>
  	When you play a song and there must not be any delays while playing you
  	may have to lock the screen by enabling  <img src="tools/screen_locked.png" width="12px" height="12px"/> in the <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a>. This mean
  	that the <a href="event_view.html">	event view</a> does not follow the cursor while playing, because the
  	repainting of the window can cause a short delay on slower machines.
