	<h1><b>Recording Midi Data</b></h1>
	
	<p>
	  MidiEditor is able to record Midi data from an <a href="setup.html#io">input device</a>, e.g. a digital piano.
	</p>
	
  <p>
    To start a recording, press the record button in the <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a> or in the toolbar.
    MidiEditor will start a <a href="playback.html">playback</a> (which will allow you to hear any in advance entered Midi events) and listen to the
	  <a href="setup.html#io">input device</a> at the same time. Hence, played notes (and other events) which where entered using the
	  <a href="setup.html#io">input device</a> can be added to the currently loaded Midi file which will add the events at the time they were played.
	</p>

	<p>
	  After a recording has been finished, click the stop button in the  <a href="menu-playback.html">playback menu</a> or in the toolbar. If any events
	  have been recorded, a dialog will pop up which allows you to specify how to handle the recorded events.
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can ignore some event types. All events with this type will not be
	  added to the file, all other events will be added at the time they have
	  been played. You can specify the track and the channel of the recorded
	  events in the dialog. Pressing &quot;Ok&quot; will add the events
	  to the file.
	</p>
	
	<p>
    After the events have been added, you may want to edit the events. This can include correcting wrong notes or adjusting the timing. Especially the
    <a href="editing-midi-files.html#quantization">quantization function</a> will be useful in this context,
